--------------

* Stopped unnecessarily installing typing on recent Python versions (thanks to Louis Trezzini)
* Fixed injecting request-scoped dependencies into teradown_request handlers (fix suggested
  by Nick Krichevsky)

  used (#24)

Version 0.10.1
--------------

* Got rid of a deprecation warning when Injector 0.13.2 is used

Version 0.10.0
--------------

* Dropped support for Injector < 0.12 and Flask < 0.12
* Dropped use_annotations constructor parameter (this also fixed compatibility
  with Injector 0.13)
* At least for the time being class-based views' constructors need to be marked
  with @inject in order for dependencies to be injected

Version 0.9.0
-------------

* Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when an nonintrospectable callable
  was registered as, for example, before_request hook
* Fixed support for forward references in type hints
* Added type hints to the codebase

Backwards incompatible:

* Dropped support for Injector 0.10

Version 0.8.0
-------------

* Dropped support for Flask < 0.11, Injector < 0.10, Python 2, PyPy and PyPy 3
  (PyPy 3 will be supported in the future)
* Fixed compatibility with Injector 0.11

Version 0.7.1
-------------

* Fixed Flask 0.11 compatibility, thanks to Philip Jones for the initial patch

Version 0.7.0
-------------

* Added support for injecting into Flask-RestPlus Resource constructors
* Added support for dependencies declared using Python 3-style annotations

Version 0.6.2
-------------

* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.6.1 (requesting an interface bound in
  RequestScope outside request context got broken and would raise
  "AttributeError: scope" exception. Even though it's not a documented
  behaviour it's restored now so that backwards compatibility is preserved.

Version 0.6.1
-------------

* Python 2.6 support dropped
* Fixed a memory leak bug (a reference to thread-identity object would be kept
  forever after a request would be served by particular thread; without greenlet
  package installed thread ids (numeric values) are used so the internal
  dictionary of thread local storage grows forever; when greenlet package is
  installed greenlet objects are used as thread identities by Werkzeug so on top
  of the internal storage growing infinitely all objects referenced by those
  greenlet objects are kept alive; keywords: Eventlet, Gevent, GreenThread). See
  GH issue #9 and pull request #11, thanks to Zi Li for the fix

Version 0.6.0
-------------

* Added support for injecting into Flask-RESTFul Resource constructors

Version 0.5.0
-------------

* Removed ``init_app`` and ``post_init_app`` functions
* Fixed a bug with Flask-Injector modifying possibly shared view generated by View.as_view
  (see GH issue #6, test case provided by Nicholas Hollett)
* Work only with Injector >= 0.9.0 now

Version 0.4.0
-------------

* Deprecated ``init_app`` and ``post_init_app`` in favour of ``FlaskInjector``
* Made Flask error handlers support injection

Version 0.3.4
-------------

* Made it possible to inject into Jinja template globals

Version 0.3.3
-------------

* Accomodated to Injector >= 0.9.0
